# Welcome to the Cornell Notes Learning Vault for Obsidian

>[!cue] Cornell Notes 
>We will often use the shorthand phrase Cornell Notes to refer to the Cornell Note-Taking System. Additionally, the name of this vault is often abbreviated as CNLV.

The [[Introduction to Cornell Notes|Cornell Note-Taking System]] was developed in the 1950s at Cornell University to help students take better notes. This system has stood the test of time and proven its value. 

It will help you write better notes to improve comprehension and memory retention. Various studies have confirmed the value of Cornell Notes:
- Cornell notes are ... "effective when the synthesis, application, or evaluation is required."[*](https://soar.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1388/grasp-2008-56.pdf)
- "the method can improve students' studying and listening skills." [*](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/51151/)

I can personally attest to the value of this method, as I have used it for decades and still have notes from years ago that I reference and that have value in my life. 

Another thing I like about the Cornell Note-Taking System is that I can use it for digital note-taking and on paper. This simplifies note-taking for me, not having some unique system just for Obsidian and something different for paper.

I aim to introduce you to a modern-day approach to implementing the Cornell Note-Taking System into your note-taking process.  This vault is intended to help you with the following:
- Learn about the history and value of Cornell Notes.
- How to implement Cornell Notes into your note-taking and specifically how to do this in Obsidian.
- Along the way, several power-user tips acquired from my years of using this note-taking method

One of the best things about this system is you can use it both in taking notes on paper or digitally.  One system to rule them all? Probably not, but having a system that translates into both paradigms is helpful.

## Getting Started
### 01 Index
>[!cue] [[01 INDEX]] is the home page for this vault


This vault is your "learning lab" for exploring Cornell Notes. The vault contains a document named [[01 INDEX]]. This is the document you will use as a starting point, as it contains an index to all the training files in this vault.

### First Steps
If you are new to Cornell Notes, I recommend to start reading through these documents to lay a foundation for understanding this method of note-taking:
- [[Introduction to Cornell Notes|Introduction to the Cornell Note-Taking System]]
- [[Understanding the parts|Understanding the parts of a Cornell Note]]

### Visual Aspects
>[!cue] Sample documents

After that, take some time to look closely at the sample documents to learn the visual possibilities of Cornell Notes. Understanding how this method enhances comprehension, understanding, and retention is essential. The sample documents are found in the *Sample Document* folder. Here is a list of the examples.
- [[The History of the Aegean Sea|The History of the Aegean Sea and its Importance to Greece]]
- [[Teaching Water Painting|Teaching Adults to Water Paint]]
- [[Meeting Notes]]
- [[Nuclear Power and how it works]]
- [[New Product - Quarterly Goals]]
### Using Cornell Notes in Your Vault

>[!cue] Your Vault

- First, you need to set up your vault to support the Cornell Notes styling of notes. To do that, follow the instructions for [[Installing the snippet|Installing the CSS Snippet]].
- Then, move on to using the Cornell Notes styling in your notes. This document walks you through [[Cornell Notes in Obsidian|How to take Cornell Notes in Obsidian]].
- To speed up working with Cornell Notes in your vault, you may enable an optional bonus feature of this vault: [[Using Templates]].
