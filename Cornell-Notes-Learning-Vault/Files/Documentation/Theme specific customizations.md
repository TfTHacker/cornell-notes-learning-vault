One of the beautiful things about Obsidian is the large number of available themes, allowing us to customize the appearance of Obsidian to our personal preferences.

However, as has been stated, with great power comes great responsibility. Each of these themes makes interesting changes to the user interface of Obsidian, and some of these changes can be very different when compared from theme to theme.

This presents a significant challenge since the [[Customizing the CSS|cornell.css]] snippet also modifies Obsidian's user interface to give us the Cornell Notes layout. In designing cornell.css, good judgment was used to strike a balance that would make the snippet work with most themes.

However, it is possible to fine-tune cornell.css for various themes that are available to the community and improve the layout effects of cornell.css. This learning vault includes several examples of such tweaks for various popular themes.

These examples can be found in the snippets folder of this learning vault and they have the file name prefix of "theme-". So, for example, there is an opinionated and tweaked **theme-default-and-others.css** that can be used to give the default theme some additional improvements, according to my opinion ðŸ˜€.

To use these themes, you still need to add **cornell.css** to your vault, but then copy the additional theme file to your vault.

By default, this vault has enabled the default theme and the customization for that theme.
