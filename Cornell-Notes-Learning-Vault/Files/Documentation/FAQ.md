# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are Cornell Notes for Paper Note-taking Only?
No! While initially developed as a note-taking methodology for classroom note-taking on paper, the principles and concepts can be applied to digital note-taking. This vault shows you how to do that.

In fact, I even use the Cue and Summary concepts on a whiteboard when brainstorming with my team. The concepts of Cornell Notes can be applied to many mediums.

### Are Cornell Notes Compatible with Atomic Notes or Evergreen Notes?
Yes and no. The concepts of these note-taking methods do not conflict with one another. However, don't feel you need to use the Cornell Note method for every note. Cornell Notes are better suited for long-form notes or notes where cue callouts are advantageous. We encourage you to experiment with these styles and don't be afraid to mix and match them in your vault. They complement each other more than they oppose each other.
