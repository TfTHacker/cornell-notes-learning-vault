# Customizing Cornell Notes with the Style Settings Plugin
As mentioned in [[Customizing the CSS]], several configuration settings are used to control the visual presentation of Cornell Notes.

The Cornell Notes Learning Vault is also configured to support the Style Settings plugin. This plugin is not required to use this learning vault or Cornell Notes in your own vault. However, this plugin makes it easier to modify the visual settings of Cornell Notes.

If you choose to use this feature, install the **Style Settings** plugin by mgmeyers in your vault. Here is a shortcut to this plugin: [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings)

Once this plugin is installed, you can go into the Settings of Obsidian and select the Style Settings plugin tab. There you will see the Cornell Notes settings that can be modified.

The Style Settings plugin allows you to modify the settings used by Cornell Notes Learning Vault and provides a brief description of these settings. Please see [[Customizing the CSS]] for a more detailed description of these settings.
